SQL Transformation:

Used to execute SQL query as part of this transformation. Logic will be provided in SQL Ports section.
We can create as many output port as we like, but for each output port we have to add SQL query. Input port are available by default.
We have query mode and script Mode for below change we have done with query mode.
We have static and dynamic connect.

ForExample:

Source Table.
DatabaseName
TableName
HierarchyName
QueryPort -- which will have sql statement. select max(load_date) from plcy

By executing sql statement we get from queryport the result will be sent to Load_Date field.

Target Table:
DatabaseName
TableName
HierarchyName
Load_Date
