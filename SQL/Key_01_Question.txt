Constraint and index questions.

1. Does "Creating a primary key constraint" always create an index automatically?
If the column is not index already Oracle will create an index.
If the column is index already Oracle will not create an index.

2. Will "Dropping constraint", will drop underlying index?
If the index is created automatically with primary key contraint then while dropping constraint will drop index.
If the index is created separately then dropping constraint will not drop index. As index was created separately.

3. Will dropping "Table" will drop underlying index?
Yes.

4. Can a Primary Key creates nonunique index?
Yes. By using eferrable Novalidate key.

5. We can "unique index" or "unique Constraint" to enforce uniqueness of a column.
What is the difference? And when to use what?
Unique constraint automatically creates an unique index(but not always)
Unique Constraint is for data integrity, whereas unique index is for performance improvement.
Foreign key can be created over unique constraint, not over a unique index.
Sometimes, we might be interested to create unique index but not a unique constraint.
