Create an Index
Syntax
The syntax for creating an index in Oracle/PLSQL is:

CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index_name
  ON table_name (column1, column2, ... column_n)
  [ COMPUTE STATISTICS ];
UNIQUE
It indicates that the combination of values in the indexed columns must be unique.
index_name
The name to assign to the index.
table_name
The name of the table in which to create the index.
column1, column2, ... column_n
The columns to use in the index.
COMPUTE STATISTICS
It tells Oracle to collect statistics during the creation of the index. The statistics are then used by the optimizer to choose a "plan of execution" when SQL statements are executed.

Types of indexes in Oracle
B-tree indexes: The default and most common type of index. B-tree indexes automatically stay balanced and perform well for a wide range of queries. 
Bitmap indexes: Compact indexes that work best for columns with a small set of values. 
Partitioned indexes: Consist of partitions that contain an entry for each value in an indexed column. 
Function-based indexes: Based on expressions that can include built-in or user-defined functions.
