Apache Spark Components

						DriverNode
		Where main method will run(Convert user program to task)

						ClusderNode:
			External service, launches application on set of machines
			Built-in standalone cluster manager
			other supported cluster managers(hadoop, mesos)

WorkderNode1	WorkderNode2	WorkderNode3	WorkderNode4
Task will be executed in worker nodes
Compute Nodes in Spark ( Process the tasks)

Executor1		Executor2		Executor3		Executor4
JVM Processes
Return results to driver program
Provides in-memory storage

Apache Spark Architecture: Run time architecture of spark application.

Here Master Slave architecture will be used.

Client -> DriverNode

Client submits user application code, Transformation and Actions to DriverNode

DriverNode:

Once Code is received from client, DriverNode convert code into DAG(Directed Acyclic graph)
										 ___
										|___|						Physical Execution Plan				Task1
UserApplication Code					   																Task2
Transformation				->			 ___		->				Stage1		Stage2			->		Task3
Action                                  |___|						 Task1		 Task3                  Task4
																	 Task2       Task4
										 ___
                                        |___|
										
Once code is converted int DAG and an execution plan is created, tasks will be created from it and bundled and sent to Cluster manager.

Cluster Manger launches executor in worker nodes. Now Driver will send task to executor based on data placements. 
When executor start executing task, it will registor will driver. By doing this driver has complete details of tasks and executors
