Distributed Architectures

Shared-Disk

Cluster1	Cluster2	Cluster3	Cluster4

				Shared-Disk
				
In above each cluster has access to shared-disk, each of them can read and write data into Shared-Disk

	Advantages
		Relatively simple to manage
		Single source of truth
	
	Disadvantages
		Single point of failure
		Bandwidth and network latency
		Limited scalability
	

Shared Nothing

Cluster1	Cluster2	Cluster3	Cluster4

Disk1		Disk2		Disk3		Disk4

In above each cluster has access only to Disk it is assigned 

	Advantages
		- Co-locating compute and storage avoids networking latency issues
		- Generally cheaper to build and maintain
		- improved scaling over shared-disk architecture	
	
	Disadvantages
		- Scaling still limited
		- Storage and compute tightly coupled
		- Tendency to overprovision
