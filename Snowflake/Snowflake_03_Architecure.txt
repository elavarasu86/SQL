Storage Layer:

	-Persistent and infinitely scalable cloud storage residing in cloud provider blob storage services such as AWS S3.
	-Snowflake users by proxy get the availability and durability guarantees of the cloud providers blob storage.
	-Data loaded into Snowflake is organized by database, schemas and accessible primarily as tables.
	-Both structured and semi-structured data files can be loaded and stored in Snowflake.
	-When data files are loaded or rows inserted into a table, Snowflake reorganizes the data into its proprietary compressed, columnar table file format.
	-The data that is loaded or inserted is also partitioned into what Snowflake call micro-partitions.
	-Storage is billed by how much is stored based on a flat rate per TB calculated monthly.
	-Data is not directly accessible in the underlying blob storage, only via SQL commands.
	
Query Processing Layer:

	- The query processing layer consists of "Virtual Warehouses" that executes the processing tasks required to return results from most SQL statement.
	- A Virtual Warehouse is a named abstraction for a cluster of a cloud-based compute instances that Snowflake manage.
	
	- Underlying nodes of a Virtual Warehouse cooperate in a similar way to a shared-nothing compute clusters making use of local caching.
	- Virtual warehouses can be creaed or removed instantly.
	- Virtual warehouses can be paused or resumed.
	- Virtually unlimited number of virtual warehouses can be created each with it's own configuration.
	- Virtual warehouses come in multiple "t-shirt" sizes indicating their relative computer power.
	- All running virtual warehouses have consistent access to the same data in the storage layer.
	
Services Layer:

	- The services layer is a collection of highly available and scalable services that coordinate activities such as authentication and query optimization across all Snowflake accounts.
	- Similar to the underlying virtual warehouse resources, the services layer also runs on cloud compute instances.
	
	- Services managed by this layer include:
		-Authentication and Access Control
		-Infrastructure Management
		-Transaction Management
		-Metadata Management
		-Query parsing and optimisation
		-Security
