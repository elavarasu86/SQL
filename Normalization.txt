First Normalization:
	1. Each field of a table may contain only one item.
	2. All of the data items in a column must mean the same thing.
	3. Each row of the table must be unique.
	4. A table must have no repeating columns
	
Example:
Student_Name		Course Titles
Arun Kumar			Computer Science, Math,Physics
Ramesh Krishna		Physics,Chemistry
Arun Vijay			Music
Ramesh Krishna		Physics,Chemistry

In above table Student Name is combination of first and last name that is possible but 2 and 4th record are exactly same.

ID	Student_Name		Course Titles
1	Arun Kumar			Computer Science, Math,Physics
2	Ramesh Krishna		Physics,Chemistry
3	Arun Vijay			Music
4	Ramesh Krishna		Physics,Chemistry

with above change no record is duplicate of another, but still couse title has multiple value in it that violates First normal form.


ID	Student_Name		Course Titles		Course Titles2	Course Titles3
1	Arun Kumar			Computer Science 	Math			Physics
2	Ramesh Krishna		Physics				Chemistry
3	Arun Vijay			Music
4	Ramesh Krishna		Physics				Chemistry

with above change no multiple value in single column but columns are repeating also lot of records has lot of null value fields.

ID	Student_Name		Course Titles
1	Arun Kumar			Computer Science 	
1	Arun Kumar			Math			
1	Arun Kumar			Physics
2	Ramesh Krishna		Physics				
2	Ramesh Krishna		Chemistry
3	Arun Vijay			Music
4	Ramesh Krishna		Physics

Second Normalization:
	1. Data must be in First Normal form.
	2. No partial dependency.
	3. Occurs when there is composite key.
	
Example:

StudentID	Course		Name	Marks	Teacher
101			Physics		Venky	85		Jack
102			Chemisty	Vetri	90		Mike
101			Tamil		Venky	75		Selvam
104			English		Adhavan	63		Prema
105			History		Sam		73		Taylor
106			Biology		Ela		93		Sam

In the above table if we consider StudentID as primary key, Student 101 has two entries
so it alone cannot be primary key for the table, we can add course also into primary key,
then each record become unique. When two or more column combined it becomes composite key(primary key). If you see teacher field that field is depend on Course field(partially depend on primary key) physics is thought by jack, chemistry is thought by mike and so on there is no relationship between studentid and teacher field. This is called partial dependency.

Above table can be converted into below to be in 2nd normal form.
Table1:
StudentID	Course		Name	Marks	
101			Physics		Venky	85		
102			Chemisty	Vetri	90		
101			Tamil		Venky	75		
104			English		Adhavan	63		
105			History		Sam		73		
106			Biology		Ela		93		
Table2:
Course		Teacher
Physics		Jack
Chemistry   Mike
Tamil       Selvam
English     Prema
History     Taylor
Biology     Sam

***********************************************************
Third Normal Form:
	1. Should be in 2NF.
	2. No Transitive dependency
	3. Occurs when you can guess value of any column from non key column.
	
Example:

S.no	Country	Groud	Capacity
1		AusvsEngMCG		80K
2		ZimVsEngHobart	30K
3		IndVsSAChepak	65

In the above table capacity field is depend on Ground field, Ground field is not a primary key field, if a non key field depends on non key field then it becomes Transitive dependency.	

Above table can be converted into below ones.
Table1:
S.no	Country	Groud	
1		AusvsEngMCG		
2		ZimVsEngHobart	
3		IndVsSA	Chepak	

Table 2:
Groud	Capacity
MCG		80K
Hobart	30K
Chepak	65
